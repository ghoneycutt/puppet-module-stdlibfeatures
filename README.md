# puppet-module-stdlibfeatures
===

New (developed past v3.2.0) features from [puppetlabs/stdlib](https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-stdlib/tree/3.2.0) are backported
here. This way we can use the new functionality without having to upgrade
stdlib entirely. This is needed since not all of our modules have been tested with the newer versions of stdlib, though we want some of the new features.
